				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
					Devil Fruits are mysterious, distinctive fruits scattered throughout the world, known for granting their eaters permanent superhuman powers and an equally permanent inability to swim.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a whole, Devil Fruits encompass hundreds of different powers, from the (apparently) mundane to the inherently mass-destructive. These are broadly grouped along three classes: 
					<ol>
						<li id="parameciaDef">
							<b>Paramecia</b> - The most common of the three Devil Fruit types, Paramecia-type Devil Fruits grant their users superhuman powers other than animals transformation or elemental transformation; such powers as shock wave generation and locking onto targets. Paramecia Fruits can alter features of the user's body such as a rubber physique or a body of blades. Some Paramecia Fruits allow the user to modify the people, objects, and environment around them, like by making things levitate or turning people into toys. Finally, there are some users that can generate and manipulate substances, such as wax and poison.	
						</li>
						<li id="zoanDef">
							<b>Zoan</b> - The rarest and most powerful of the three Devil Fruit types, Logia-type Devil Fruits allow their users to create, control, and transform their body into a natural element, such as ice, mud, smoke, fire, or darkness. The elemental transformation effectively makes the user intangible, as well as allowing the user to remain in control of their body, even when it is broken into pieces. They also gain every ability related to that element, such as sand being able to absorb moisture or lightning being able to travel through conductive objects.
						</li>
						<li id="logiaDef">
							<b>Logia</b> - The users of Zoan-type Devil Fruits gain the ability to transform into an animal, as well as transform into a hybrid form of their own species and the species the fruit allows them to transform into. A recently discovered science allows Zoan Fruits to be integrated into objects, bringing the object to life and granting it the standard Zoan transformations. Carnivorous animal Zoans are better suited for combat.
						</li>
					</ol>
